# What is  Software engineering 
Software engineering a engineering discipline that is concern with all the stage of software production from system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use 
Engineering discipline : 
- Using the appropriate theories and method to solve problems bearing in mind organizational and financial constraints 
All aspects of software production : 
- not just technical process of development , also project management and development of tools , method etc . to support software production 


# Software cost 
Software cost often dominate computer system costs . The cost of software on a PC are often 

greater than the hardware cost 
software cost more to maintain that it does to develop  

Software engineering is concerned with cost-effective software development 


# Software product 
Generic products 
- Standalone system that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them 
Customized products  
- Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs 

# Frequently asked questions about software engineering 
## What is software ? 
- computer programs and associated documentation . Software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market 
## What are the attributes of a good software ? 
- good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and usable 

## What is software engineering ? 
- Software engineering is  an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production  
## What are the fundamental software engineering activities ? 
- software specification , software development , software validation and software evolution 
## What is the difference between  software engineering and computer science 
- Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals ; software engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing an delivering useful software 
## What are the key challenges facing software engineering ? 
- Coping with increasing diversity  , demands for reduced delivery times and developing trustworthy software 

## What are the costs of software engineering ? 
- Roughly 60% of software cost are development cost , 40% are testing costs . For customer software , evolutions cost often exceed development cost 


# Essential atributes of good software 

## Maintainability 
- software should be written in such a way so that it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers . This is a critical attribute because software change is an inevitable requirement of changing business environment  

## Dependability  and Security 
- Software dependability includes a range of  characteristics including  reliability , security  and safety . Dependable software should not cause physical or economic damage in the event of system failure . Malicious user should bot be able to access or damage the system 

## Efficiency 
- software should not make wasteful use of system resources suck as memory and processor cycles . efficiency therefore includes responsiveness , processing time , memory utilisation  , etc
## Acceptability 
- software should be accpected by the type of user for which it is designed . This mean that it must be understandale , useable , and compatible with other system they use 


# Software process activities 
Software specification , where customer and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operations 

Software development ,where the software is designed and programmed 

Software validation , where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires 

software evolution , where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements 


# General issues that affect most software 
## Heterogeneity 
- increasing , system are required to operat as distributed system across network that include different types  of computer and mobile devices 
## Business and social change 
- Business and society are changing incredibly quickly as emerging economies develop and new technologies become available . They need to be able to change their existing software  and rapidly develop new software 

## Security and trust 
- as software is intertwined with all aspect of our lives , it is essential that we can trust that software 
# Software engineering diversity 
- There are many different types of software system and there is no universal set of software techniques that is applicable to all these 
- The software engineering method and tools used  depend on the type of application being developed , the requirement of the customer and the background of the development team 



# Application types 
## Stand alone application 
- these are application systems tlhat run a on a local computer such as a PC . They include all necessary funcionality and do not need to be connectd to a network 

## Interactive transaction based applications 
- Applications that execute on a remote computer and are accessed by users from their own PC or terminal these include web application such as e commerce application 
## Embedded control systems  
- These are software contol system that control and manage hardware devices 
## Batch processing systems 
- These are business systems that are designed to process data in large batches . They process large number of individual input to create corresponding outputs 
## Entertainment systems 
- these are systems that are primarily for personal use and which are intended to entertain the user 
## Systems for modelling and simulation 
- These are systems that are developed by  scientists and engineers to model physical processes or situations , which include many , separate , interacting objects 
## data collecting systems 
- these are systems that collect data from their environment using a set of sensor and send data to other systems for processing 
## Systems of systems  
- These are systems that are composed of a number of other software systems 



# Software engineering fundamentals 
Some fundamental principles apply to all types of software systems , irrespective of the development technique used : 
- Systems should be developed using a managed and understood development process . Of course , different processes are used for different types of software 
- Dependability and performance are important for all types of systems 
- Understanding a managing the software specification and requirements (what the software should do) are important 
- when appropriate , you should reuse software that has already been develped rether than write new software 
# Case studies 
A personal insuline pump 
- an embedded system in an insuline pump used by diabetics to maintain blood glucose control  
A mental health case patient management system 
- A system used to maintain record of people reveiving care for mental health problems 
A wilderness weather station 
- A data collection system that collects data about weather conditions in remote areas
