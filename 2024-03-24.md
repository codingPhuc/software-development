Software development  
effective software design is effective for framework for the need in our project 
apply UML 
understanding these project will ensure UML both effective and importance 

there are different way for software development it should be a structure approach 
project more complex , need for soiled development is needed 
water fall :
 - build house in detail blueprint 
 - requirement is set in stone 
agil : 
- change imbracing 
- more flexiable in development process 
no system can map out software process , handing process , bugeting and maintanain 

water fall : 
- break down into different step 
- start with requirement stage 
	- see the requirement 
	- well done set for good outcome 
 - design much be clear 
	 - future 
 - implementation 
	 -  show that it meet the set critieral 
- test 
	- address any bug that require 
- maintianability 
	- fix small bug 
 - waterfall is best for clear  instruction , it not good in adapting new requirement 
agile : 
- born for agile manifesto 
- 4 key value 
	- indvidual are needed for 
	- working software over comprehensive documentation 
		- only product document for real value 
	- customer collaboration over contract expatation 
		- combine customer and dev trust and colaboration 
	- flexibility 
		- no exhausting detail  
		- no need  for every question to be answer 
		- develop software in spint 
		- each software is developed and fix  
	- interated testing in the whole project 
	- agile is a way of thinking 
		- Scrum 
		- Kanban 
		- offer strucutre framework 
		- ideal for project that are uncertan and change  good for avoiding rigit documentation 
waterfall or Agil  
- waterfall is more rigit then Agil 
- project is uncertain then Agil 
- requirement are clear and unlike change waterfall is more acceptable 




Sure, I can help restructure this information to make it more readable. Here’s a revised version:

# Software Development

Effective software design is crucial for creating a framework that meets the needs of our project. Applying UML (Unified Modeling Language) and understanding these projects will ensure both effectiveness and importance.

There are different approaches to software development, and a structured approach should be adopted. As projects become more complex, the need for solid development methodologies is needed.

## Waterfall Model

The Waterfall model is like building a house with a detailed blueprint where the requirements are set in stone. It involves breaking down the project into different steps:

1. **Requirement Stage**: The requirements are clearly defined and set for a good outcome.
2. **Design**: The design must be clear and future-proof.
3. **Implementation**: The implementation should meet the set criteria.
4. **Testing**: This stage addresses any bugs that require fixing.
5. **Maintainability**: This involves fixing small bugs.

The Waterfall model is best for projects with clear instructions. However, it’s not good at adapting to new requirements.

## Agile Model

The Agile model embraces change and offers more flexibility in the development process. It was born from the Agile Manifesto and has four key values:

1. **Individuals and Interactions**: Individuals are needed for the project.
2. **Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation**: Only produce documents that provide real value.
3. **Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**: Combine customer and developer trust and collaboration.
4. **Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**: No need for every question to be answered. Develop software in sprints, with each software developed and fixed.

Agile also involves integrated testing throughout the project. It’s a way of thinking and offers structured frameworks like Scrum and Kanban. It’s ideal for projects that are uncertain and subject to change, and it’s good for avoiding rigid documentation.

## Waterfall vs Agile

The Waterfall model is more rigid than Agile. If a project is uncertain, then Agile is more suitable. However, if the requirements are clear and unlikely to change, the Waterfall model is more acceptable.
