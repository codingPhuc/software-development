non strucuture programming was the eiliers 
- each statemnt would go into a single line 
- maintianing suck a code bases was challenging 
- number of code line increased 
- created spagety code 
structured programming 
- break down code into server step 
- operating on variable and data structure 
- used the name of the variable to access the store value 
 - Data strucutre 
	 - a way of organizing data in a comuputer program 
	 - relies on subroutine 
	 - name make it easier to read 
Oject oriented programming 
- split appart the programming into different part of the system 
- operates on its own data 
- Object orientation aim to bring programming close to the real world 
- Object represent a thing 
- Object may contian or refer to as other object 
- Ojbject can have propeties  some attribute can change and some cannot 
- Object can have identity it own state ,
- Object can have a behavior ( it can do action like a black dog Backing) 
	- here the dog is the object , black is the properties andBacking is the action 
- Identify thier identity , class is like a plan  a description of what the class would be , each object have name , amor level and a hit point 
	- we identiyfy a class by it name properties and action 
	- method is function embleded in a class 
	- each object will have name amor level and hit point 
	- class can  created many instance as we  need 
	- we don't need to reinvent the wheel for action already implemented 
 Abtraction 
 - describing compress problem in easier term 
 - if you say cat you know ( you understand that i talk about a cat skip the implement detail and you understand us)
 - focus on essiential properties and discard the unssiential one 
 Encapsulation data hiding 
 - encapsulat something to protect it and keep it reponsible 
 - hiding the gear and the letter 
 - only revel the essential freature 
 - data hidding retrice client from modifiing the essential problem 
 - data hiding is about protecting classes for external properties 
 - keeping the dependency of an object 
 - only show what  in a classes when necssary 
Inheritant 
- is a key concept in OOP 
- reused code implemntation in new classes 
- let say that we have pokemon class we can used that to inherited to pokemon with different type but the attribute with speacial attack type all classes should be simple each class should stick to simple implementation 
- inherientance a class can inherited from it parent class this tranfer the attribute and properties of the parent class 
Polymorphism 
- polys many much , morphism change ( the occurent in many differnt form )
- method overriding by overrding the method from the super class and  implement our own behavior 
- working with many instances when inheriting a parent class 

# Object Oriented design and Unified Modeling 
1. collect the requirement 
	1. identify the problem need to be slove 
	2. document important decision 
	3. decsirbe the app from the user perpective 
2. Descibe the app 
	1. non functional prototype 
	2. ask create a IOS app prototype will give client the clear ideal 
 3. identify the thing that form our system  
  4. descibe the classes in  a fomular way 
	  1. UML is way to create a system 

Collecting requirement 
- requirement collection phase requirement analysis 
	-  requirement is thing that are needed and created 
- should the actual  screen 
 - non functional requirement 
	 - requiremnt that are not essential 
	 - like runtime 
	 - law  in each country 
	 - documentation and support 
- write them down 
	- the app and system would need to do thing and that 
	- pen and paper are also just find 
	- we need to understand what the application much do and how should we do it 
	- agil let us revisit and refine the requirement 
Used cases need a 
- title something like convert new state 
- actor the user of the system  
- Senerio what and how the system work 
- create a new trip
- the description should be understood by different user 
	- how each actor interact with it 
	- user story is a common way of desriping 
	- ``as <type user> so <some goal> for <some reason>``
		- if you cannot have user stories in one sentence then you need to do it in many sentence 
		- as a  use , i want to creat new trips so that I can track them in different user 
		- stories to ignite discussion 
object oriented design 
- how object interact with each other 
- different non standard appoaraches 
- UML provide a set of standard diagram for structure and software system 







## UML basics & Fundamental Diagram types  
UML introuduct for better communication 
diagram that model software system 
model object that form a system 
Use case diagram 
- descripe strucutre system for the user view 
model diamic behavior the interaction between object 
UML is independent of any programming language 
they can be convert to source code if it is enough  

we need to figure out what to implement to do code 
skectch software for functionality 
thing about class object interaction , what should be implemented  
design help communicate with other dev , start discussion without going into source code 
design instruction revierse 



# Example of the used cases 

Elevator 


Actor 
- User 
- Technician 
what can the user do 
- Called the elevator 
- select the floor 
- Ride the Elevator 
- Opperate door 
- trigger alarm  
what can the technician do 
- inspect Elevator 
- services Elevator 
- Repair Elevator 



Class diagram 
- we start creating class diagram  
- three compactment 
- naming of the classes 
	- start with the uppercases letter (upper camelcases)
	- common rule for good source code even if they are from another country 
- attribute the first letter lower cases 
- method first letter is lowercases while  
Class diagram challenge 
- actor is the elevator 
-  name your class using a upperCamelCase 
- the robot must have a unique identifier 
- robot can diagnose , service and repair 
- keep your class simple and 



Visibility  :  
+public  : can be also used by code outside of the object
-private : can only be accessed within the defining class 
`#protected`: accessible from the defining and child classes 
`~package` : available within its enclosing package 



there is only one rule expost as much as needed and hide everything else 
this let us control what the collor control in our trip atribute 
trip name is never shorter than 3 character start date need to be 

to get the items you need to provide getter and setter 


as a traveler I want to track my expensive when I am aboard so that i won't over due my welcome , classes refer to each other 
should the expense class should also know about the trip class 

Association  : 
- the associated class does not know anything about it parent associate 
- drawing a line that represent the multiplicity of associated oject 
- * trip can have multilple expensive 
- 1 trip can have one homeCurrecy 
- 0..1 trip can have 1to 0  

Generalization : 
- generalization one model element is bases on another model element 
- parent can have multiple childrent 
	- there are many programming that enable multiple inheritain 
- multiple inheritance have more benefit than draw back  
- indicate that a child element inherited it parent used cases opeartion and relation ship 
dependency : 
- association indicate  that a class has attribute of the other class type , whereas dependency is  usually create when a class receive a referent  form another class
Aggregation : 
-represent a partwhole relationship and its drawn as a solid  line and a  diamon as it owner end 
- comprosite is owner ship when the owner object is destroy then the owns object will be remove to 
Realization : 
- Realization indicates that a class implements the behavior specified by another model element 
-  hollow triangle and a dash line this is a used full feature

Sure, hereâ€™s the information organized into sections:

## Class Diagram

- Class diagrams are created with three compartments.
- Classes are named starting with an uppercase letter (UpperCamelCase), a common rule for good source code.

### Attributes and Methods

- Attributes start with a lowercase letter.
- Methods also start with a lowercase letter.

### Class Diagram Challenge

- The actor is the elevator.
- Name your class using UpperCamelCase.
- The robot must have a unique identifier.
- The robot can diagnose, service, and repair.
- Keep your class simple.

## Visibility

- `+public`: Can also be used by code outside of the object.
- `-private`: Can only be accessed within the defining class.
- `#protected`: Accessible from the defining and child classes.
- `~package`: Available within its enclosing package.

The rule is to expose as much as needed and hide everything else. This lets us control what the caller controls in our trip attribute. The trip name is never shorter than 3 characters, and the start date needs to be set.

To get the items, you need to provide getter and setter methods.

## Association

- The associated class does not know anything about its parent associate.
- Draw a line that represents the multiplicity of associated objects.
- A trip can have multiple expenses (`*`).
- A trip can have one home currency (`1`).
- A trip can have 0 to 1 (`0..1`) trips.

## Generalization

- Generalization is when one model element is based on another model element.
- A parent can have multiple children.
- There are many programming languages that enable multiple inheritance.
- Indicate that a child element inherited its parent use cases, operations, and relationships.

## Dependency

- Association indicates that a class has an attribute of the other class type, whereas dependency is usually created when a class receives a reference from another class.

## Aggregation

- Represents a part-whole relationship and is drawn as a solid line with a diamond at its owner end.
- Composite is ownership. When the owner object is destroyed, then the owned object will be removed too.

## Realization

- Realization indicates that a class implements the behavior specified by another model element.
- It is represented by a hollow triangle and a dashed line.


## Sequence Diagram 
- show how object interact with each other 
- dynamic diagram on how object communicate with each other
- flow of logic in one sernario 
- start by box at top page 
- a follow by name or name : class 
- show message send one object to another 
	- message is method call 
- asyncanization message help with operation that need a lot of computaion time 
- thick arrow head to represent a asyn and normal for other 
- you can also have a self call 
- you dont try to represent a message call directly  
- inner working object in a sernario 
- the process of finding a software system is finding out what missing and what need to be change 

# activity diagram 
- activity diagram is used to model the flow of activities in a system and the decision that are made along the way for work flow and buinisss processes 
- activity diagram is made of 2 
	- nods : represent action 
	- flow show the flow of control between action 
![[side_5_activitydiagram.PNG]]
- here we start with a initial node  
- the arraw between two node is a flow 
- then reaching a decision node it will have a guard condtions , the guard condition need to be execusive 
![[side_5_activitydiagram1.PNG]]
- after the conditional action it can then be merge into a Merge activity 
![[side_5_activitydiagram2.PNG]]
- when a activity reach a parralized options like here the workflow is split into different action representing a black bar  (this is like when a file is being downloaded and the system also send you a downloaeded email )
- then the action will be merge into one by a black bar with the final node being a  white circle with a smaller circle inside 


# Statechart diagram 
made up of 3 main element
state represent the current condition 
transition show that an object switches state 
event when the user Trigger a transition 

![[side_5_statediagram.PNG]]- here the state is initialize as a black circle 
- the node then have a flow to the beginning state of the object (Uninitialized) 
- the state then have event which trigger bases on the given guard condition 
- and the final state outcome 

![[side_5_statediagram1.PNG]]
the state then transition to the completed node which will trigger the delete event causing the end 


design a note taking application from 
1. Clarify the requirement  
2. write user stories 
3. map user stories to use case diagrams 
4. identify main entities and realtionship 
5. model behavior 
6. Represent object states 


step  1 : 
collecting the requirement  start thing of some feture this application much need  
- create and edit text based notes 
- attach photos/video 
- Capture hand drawn sketches 
- password protect individual notes 
- Sensitive note can be protected from prying eyes using password 
- the app should automatically sync with services for data loss 
non functional requirement  
- app should be easy to used  
- the app must run on the latest  IOS 
- the app should handle a large number of notes 
- the app must be secure 
- Include a dedicated support email and website 

Collecting the Requirement  
- what the software should do and how it should work 
- Create a list of requirement 
The water flow approach is that we should done the software validation process before anything else 


## Mapping user stories 
User stories is used to focus on the user need and the value that they get from the application 
identify 3 main topic 

Note creation and editing 
-  create and edit text based notes 
- attach photos/video 
- Capture hand drawn sketches 
- As a user  

security /password protection  
- Sensitive note can be protected from prying eyes using password 
syncing with the cloud 
- the app should automatically sync with services for data loss
