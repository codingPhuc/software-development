1. DNS 
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through [domain names](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/), like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through [Internet Protocol (IP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/internet-protocol/) addresses. DNS translates domain names to [IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) so browsers can load Internet resources.

Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).
1. Load Balancer 
In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), **load balancing** is the process of distributing a set of [tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(computing) "Task (computing)") over a set of [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_resource "System resource") (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left

11. CDN  (Content delivery network)
A **content delivery network** or **content distribution network** (**CDN**) is a geographically distributed network of [proxy servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server "Proxy server") and their [data centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center "Data center"). The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to [end users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user "End user"). CDNs came into existence in the late 1990s as a means for alleviating the performance bottlenecks of the Internet[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network#cite_note-:0-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network#cite_note-2) as the Internet was starting to become a mission-critical medium for people and enterprises. Since then, CDNs have grown to serve a large portion of the Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics and scripts), downloadable objects (media files, software, documents), applications ([e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce "E-commerce"), [portals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_portal "Web portal")), [live streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_streaming "Live streaming") media, on-demand streaming media, and [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media") sites.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network#cite_note-3)
