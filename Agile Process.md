| Principle               | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| People not process      | The skill of the development  team should be recognized and exploited . Team members should be left to **develop** their **own ways** of working **without prescriptive** processes |
| Embrace **change**      | Expect the system requirement to change and so **design** the system to **accommodate** these Changes                                                                               |
| Maintain **simplicity** | **Focus** on **simplicity** in both the software being developed and in the development  process . Wherever possible , actively work to **eliminate complexity** from the system    |
| Customer Involvement    | Customer should be closely involved throughout the development process . Their role is provide and prioritize new system requirement and to evaluate the interaction of the system  |
| Incremental delivery    |  The software is developed in increment with the customer specifying the requirement to be included in each increment                                                               |
## Agile method applicability 
**Product** development where a software company is developing a **small** or **medium-sized** product for sale 
Customer system **development within** an **organization** , where there is a **clear commitment** from the customer to become involved in the  development process  and where there are not a lot of **external rule** and regulation that **affect** the software 
Because of the focus on **small** , tightly-integrated teams  , there are **problems** in scaling agile method to **large system** 


## Problem with agile method 
It can be difficult to keep the **interest** of customer who are involved in the process 
Team **member** are not suited for the increase involvement in the agile method 
**priority change** can be difficult when there are multiple stark holder 
Maintaining simplicity require **extra work** 
Contracts may be a  problem as with other approaches to interactive development

# Agile method and software maintenance 
most company more money in maintaining then dev , so agile need to support **maintenance + original development** 


## plan driven and agile development 
A plan driven approach to software engineering is based around **separate development** stages with the output of each stages plan in advance 
## Agile development  
design implement and testing are interleave with the output being decided thought development at each software process

# Scrum  
The Scrum **approach** is a **general  agile**  method but it forcus is on managing  interactive development rather than specific agile practices 
There are **Three phases** in Scrum  
- The **initial phase** is an outline planning phase where you establish the general objective for the project and design the software architecture 
- This follow by a series of **sprint cycle** , where each cycle developed and increment of the object 
- The **project closure phase** wraps up the project , complete required documentation such as system help frame and user manual and assesses the lesson learn from the project

## key point 
²Agile methods are incremental development methods that focus on rapid development, frequent releases of the software, reducing process overheads and producing high-quality code. They involve the customer directly in the development process.

²The decision on whether to use an agile or a plan-driven approach to development should depend on the type of software being developed, the capabilities of the development team and the culture of the company developing the system.

²Extreme programming is a well-known agile method that integrates a range of good programming practices such as frequent releases of the software, continuous software improvement and customer participation in the development team.
