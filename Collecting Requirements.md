## Requirement Collection Phase

- Requirements are things that are needed and created.
- Show the actual screen.
- Non-functional requirements are not essential, like runtime, laws in each country, documentation, and support.
- Write them down. The application and system would need to do things and that. Pen and paper are also just fine.
- We need to understand what the application must do and how should we do it.
- Agile lets us revisit and refine the requirements.
