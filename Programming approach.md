# Non-Structured Programming

- Each statement would go into a single line.
- Maintaining such a code base was challenging as the number of code lines increased.
- This often resulted in spaghetti code.

# Structured Programming

- Code is broken down into several steps.
- Operations are performed on variables and data structures.
- The name of the variable is used to access the stored value.

## Data Structure

- A way of organizing data in a computer program.
- Relies on subroutines.
- Names make it easier to read.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Programming is split apart into different parts of the system.
- Each part operates on its own data.
- OOP aims to bring programming closer to the real world.

## Objects

- An object represents a thing.
- An object may contain or refer to other objects.
- Objects can have properties; some attributes can change and some cannot.
- Objects can have an identity and a state.
- Objects can have behavior (e.g., a black dog barking).

## Class

- A class is like a plan, a description of what the object would be.
- Each object has a name, armor level, and hit points.
- A class is identified by its name, properties, and actions.
- A method is a function embedded in a class.
- A class can create as many instances as needed.

## Abstraction

- Describing complex problems in simpler terms.
- Focus on essential properties and discard the nonessential ones.

## Encapsulation and Data Hiding

- Encapsulate something to protect it and keep it responsible.
- Only reveal the essential features.
- Data hiding restricts clients from modifying the essential problem.
- Data hiding is about protecting classes from external properties.
- Only show whatâ€™s in a class when necessary.

## Inheritance

- A key concept in OOP.
- Reuse code implementation in new classes.
- A class can inherit from its parent class, transferring the attributes and properties of the parent class.

## Polymorphism

- The occurrence in many different forms.
- Method overriding by overriding the method from the superclass and implementing our own behavior.
- Working with many instances when inheriting a parent class.
