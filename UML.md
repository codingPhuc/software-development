# what is the UML ? 
The Unified modeling Language (UML) is a family of grapchial  notations that help in **describing and [[Software process#Software design and implementation]]** , particularly software systems built using object oriented (OOP) style 

The UML is relatively open standard ,  control by the Object Management Group(OMG) , an open  consortium company 

The UML was born after many OOP  graphical language that thrived in the late 1980 


# way of using the UML  
At the heart of the role of the role in UML is the different way people used it 

Characterization of three model in which people used the UML sketch , blue print an programming language 

By far the most common way of the three is used UML as sketch , dev used the UML as a way to communicate a part of the system , like blue print you can used UML as a forward engineering or reverse engineering direction 

UML as sketch is to be a basic for which you can communicate with other people ideal and functionality that need to be made clear 
UML as blue print is detail describe of the program without much back and fourth need that the programmer can implement  

In this environment developers , draw UML diagram that can be directly complied to programming executable code , and the UML become the source code 


UML defines 13 diagrams that describe 4 +1 architecture views

# Use Cases 
[[Used cases]] are technique  for capturing the **functional requirement** of a System .Use cases work by describing the typical **interaction** between the user of the system and system itself , providing a  narrative of how a system is used 


# Sequence Diagrams 
 [[Sequence Diagrams]] **Interactive diagram describe how group of object collaborate in some behavior** . The UML define server form of UML one of which is sequence diagram 
Typically , a sequence  diagram captures the **behavior of a single scenario**. The diagram show a number of example object and the message that are passed between these object within the use case
