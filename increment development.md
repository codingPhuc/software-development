Rather than deliver the system as a single delivery , the development and delivery is **broken down into increment** which each increment delivering **part of the require functionality** 

user require increment are prioritize and the highest priority requirement are included in the initial increment 

One development for a increment is started , the other increment will be **frozen** thought the later increment can continue to evolve and change 

## Increment development and delivery 
Incremental development 
- Develop the increment and evaluate each increment before moving to the development of the next increment 
- Normal approach used in **agile method** 
- **Evaluation** done by **user/customer** proxy 
Incremental delivery 
- **Deploy** an **increment** for used by **end-user** 
- **more realistic evaluation** about practical use software 
- Difficult to implement for replacement system as increment have less functionality than the system being replace

## Incremental delivery advantages 
**Customer** value can be delivered with each increment so system functionality is available **earlier** 
**Early increment** act as a prototype to help **elicit** requirement for later increment 
**Lower risk** of overall project **failure** 
The **highest priority system** service tend to receive the **most testing** 



## Incremental delivery problems 
Most system require a set of **basic facilities** that are used by different part of the system 
- as requirement are not defined  in detail until an increment is to be implemented , it can be **hard** to **identify common facilities** that are needed by all increment 
The essence of iterative process is the the specification is developed in conjunction with the software 
- However, this conflicts with the procurement model of many organizations , where **complete system specification is part of the system development contract**
