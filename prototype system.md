A prototype is the initial design of the system used to demonstrate concept and try out design options 

A prototype can be used in : 
- The requirements engineering process to help with the requirement elicitation and validation 
- In design processes to explore options and develop a UI design 
- In testing process to run back to back tests 
### benefit of prototyping 
Improved system usability  
A closer match to the user real need 
Improve design quality 
Improve maintainability 
Reduce development effort

## prototype development 
May be based on rapid prototyping language or tools 

May involve leaving out[exclude] functionality  
- Prototype should focus on areas of the product that are not well
- Error checking and recovery may not be included in the prototype 
- Focus on **function** rather then **non-functional** requirement such as security and reliability 

## Throw away prototypes 
**Prototype** should be thought away after development because they are not a good basic for production systems : 
- It may be impossible to tune the system after to meet non-functional requirement 
- The prototype structure are usually degraded thought rapid change 
- The prototype usually do not meet normal organizational quality standard
