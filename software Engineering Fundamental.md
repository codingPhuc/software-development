# What is  Software engineering 
Software engineering a engineering discipline that is concern with all the stage of software production from system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use 
Engineering discipline : 
- Using the appropriate theories and method to solve problems bearing in mind organizational and financial constraints 
All aspects of software production : 
- not just technical process of development , also project management and development of tools , method etc . to support software production 
## What is software engineering ? 
- Software engineering is  an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production  

## What are the fundamental software engineering activities ? 
- [[Software process#Software specification]] ,  software development , software validation and software evolution 
## What is the difference between  software engineering and computer science 
- Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals ; software engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing an delivering useful software 

## What are the key challenges facing software engineering ? 
- Coping with increasing diversity  , demands for reduced delivery times and developing trustworthy software 

## What are the costs of software engineering ? 
- Roughly 60% of software cost are development cost , 40% are testing costs . For customer software , evolutions cost often exceed development cost 

# Software  
## What is software ? 
- computer programs and associated documentation . [[Software]] products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market 
## What are the attributes of a good software ? 
- good [[software]] should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and usable 
# Software process activities 
 [[ Software process]]  specification , where customer and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operations 

Software development ,where the software is designed and programmed 

Software validation , where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires 

software evolution , where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements 


# Software engineering fundamentals 
Some fundamental principles apply to all types of software systems , irrespective of the development technique used : 
- Systems should be developed using a managed and understood development process . Of course , different processes are used for different types of software 
- Dependability and performance are important for all types of systems 
- Understanding a managing the software specification and requirements (what the software should do) are important 
- when appropriate , you should reuse software that has already been develped rether than write new software 




## Object-Oriented Design and Unified Modeling When designing software 

### 1. [[Collecting Requirements]]

- Identify the problem that needs to be solved.
- Document important decisions.
- Describe the application from the userâ€™s perspective.
### 2. Describing the Application

- Create a non-functional prototype.
- For example, creating an iOS app prototype will give the client a clear idea.

### 3. Identifying System Components

- Identify the things that form our system.

### 4. Describing Classes

- Describe the classes in a formal way.
- [[UML]] is a way to create a system.
